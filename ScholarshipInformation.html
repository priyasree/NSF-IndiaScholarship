                    <mark>North South Foundaton (NSF)</mark> provides scholarships to undergraduate students entering into engineering, medicine or 3-year polytechnic (diploma in engineering.)
                    based on merit and financial need. NSF uses uniform eligibility criteria to identify meritorious students across chapters.
                    NSF has distributed more than 12,000 scholarships to students who need financial support to pursue their quest for knowledge in their chosen fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scholarship is an annual award and not a one-time payment. The student is eligible for the scholarship until graduation as long as
                    he/she maintains high academic standards. NSF funds these scholarships by raising donations in the US. The local chapters located in various
                    states in India do the commendable job of advertising to invite applications from students, screening these applications and selecting the most
                    needy group of students who eventually become NSF scholarship recipients. Scholarship amounts range from INR 5,000 to INR 15,000 per student year.

                <p>
                    While a donation to NSF goes towards the general pool of college scholarships, some time if a donor wishes to support a
                    student from one college or a student in a specific course of study NSF finds an eligible student and gives a designated scholarship.

                    donor who wishes to help students in his or her high school of choice.  Donors who have donated towards this category will be honoured here.
